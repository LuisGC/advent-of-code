This repo is meant to host mi coding solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

I have completed [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) and [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/), with [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) already ongoing: ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/2022%20day%20üìÖ-4-blue)

Check out my code and please give me feedback, it's been a while since the last time I coded that much in Python.
